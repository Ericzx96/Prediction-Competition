# Prediction-Competition
This project was a prediction competition done in my STAT 441 class at the University of Waterloo that achieved a top 10 finish in class. It uses a dataset of survey responses to predict the response to the question "how is religion important in one's life?"

In this project we will go through:
  1. Data Cleaning
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis
  3. Fitting various machine learning models which includes:
     - Random Forests
     - XGboost
     - LightGBM
